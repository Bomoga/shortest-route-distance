# Overview:

This project intends to find the shortest path from point to point when given the coordinates of a graph. It will provide the shortest path in the console, but open a display which presents a drawn line from point to point, indicating the shortest path.

# Features:

- Utilizes TSP local search to quickly ascertain the shortest path from point to point without visiting one more than once.
- Provides an easy-to-read graphical display of the solution.
- Alternatively also provides a text-based display of the solution.
  
# Usage:

The source code should be placed in an src file, where the src file is nested in an outer project file. Place the coordinate point files in the outer project file.
When the program starts, you will be prompted for the name of the file containing the coordinate points. Input NAME_OF_FILE.txt.
